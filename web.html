        <br> I made a website for myself. I hope I will make many changes in future.
        </p>

<k style = "font-size: 200%; color: white ; font-family = arial"> The Changes are :-
    <br>(Part 1)
    <br> 1. I created a background.
    <br> 2. I wrote a sentence and change its colour, font, size and underlined the headings and even add an emoji.
    <br> 3. And all of these I somehow managed to code in html with notpad.
    <br> (Part 2)
    <br> 4. In part 2 I tranfer the code form notpad to my personal fourbit software (Visual Studio), and I am pretty sure that I will carry on making changes in Visual Studio.
    <br> 5. I made a tranperent background and I want to show my text on that background just to make a kind of, profesonal look and I did that.
    <br> 6. I add light shadow to make it satisfing.
    <br> To Be Continued.....
    <br> till then goodbye and take care and stay safe...
    thank you for your patience ❤️.
